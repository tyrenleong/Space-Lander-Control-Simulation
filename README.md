# Space Lander Control Simulation

A C++ project that simulates a lander attempting to land on a newly discovered planet. 
Due to budget constraints, a single operator on Earth controls multiple landers, 
adjusting their thrusters to ensure safe landings while conserving fuel. The simulator uses 
a priority queue to manage the landers based on their altitude, fuel levels, and other factors. 
The goal is to safely land all spacecraft without crashing.
